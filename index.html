                The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over 21.<br>
                Each player is dealt one card to start the game and each one is given the opportunity to hit or stand.<br>
                If a player hits, he will be dealt another card.<br>
                If he stands, he will not be dealt another card.<br>
                Face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10, Aces are worth 11, and all other cards are worth their face value.<br>
                If a player goes over 21 he busts. he only wins when all other players are busted or he has a hand value closer to 21 than any other player who hasn't busted. In case of a tie between two or more players, it's simply considered a "Draw".<br><br>
